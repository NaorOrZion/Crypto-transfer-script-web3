# Aerodrome Slipstream PnL Analyzer

Profit-and-loss tracker for **Aerodrome Slipstream** (concentrated liquidity) positions on **Base**.

Designed for wallets that use bot-driven rebalancing (e.g. Banana Gun), where `tx.from` is a router contract rather than the LP wallet itself.

## What It Tracks

| Metric | Description |
|---|---|
| **Gross Deposited** | Total USD value of all `IncreaseLiquidity` events (every deposit, at tx-time price) |
| **Gross Withdrawn** | Total USD value of all `DecreaseLiquidity` events (every withdrawal, at tx-time price) |
| **Net Liquidity** | Gross Deposited - Gross Withdrawn (how much net capital was added/removed) |
| **Rebalances** | Number of withdraw-then-redeposit cycles detected |
| **Trading Fees** | USD earned from `Collect` events minus the principal returned in the same tx |
| **AERO Rewards** | USD value of `ClaimRewards` from the Gauge contract |
| **Gas Fees** | Total gas cost in USD for all related transactions |
| **Net Profit** | Trading Fees + AERO Rewards - Gas Fees |

---

## How It Works

### Strategy Context

Aerodrome Slipstream uses concentrated liquidity (similar to Uniswap V3). Each position is an ERC-721 NFT with a `tokenId`, holding liquidity in a specific price range for a token pair (e.g. WETH/USDC). Positions can be **staked** in a Gauge to earn AERO rewards.

A rebalancing bot periodically:
1. Unstakes the NFT from the Gauge (claims AERO rewards)
2. Withdraws liquidity (`DecreaseLiquidity` + `Collect`)
3. Re-deposits with adjusted price range (`IncreaseLiquidity`)
4. Re-stakes the NFT in the Gauge

### Attribution Logic

Since a bot initiates the transactions, the script cannot simply filter by `tx.from`. Instead it:

1. **Fetches all NFPM events** (`IncreaseLiquidity`, `DecreaseLiquidity`, `Collect`) in the block range
2. **Extracts unique `tokenId`s** from those events
3. **Checks on-chain ownership** at the end block:
   - `ownerOf(tokenId)` — direct ownership
   - `positions(tokenId).operator` — delegated operator
   - If owner is a Gauge address — the NFT is staked
4. **For staked NFTs**, verifies the transaction involves the wallet by checking:
   - `tx.from` matches the wallet
   - `Collect` event recipient matches the wallet
   - Any ERC20/ERC721 `Transfer` in the receipt has the wallet as sender or receiver
5. **Keeps only events** for tokenIds that belong to the wallet

### Fee Calculation

For each `Collect` event, the script subtracts the `DecreaseLiquidity` amounts from the same transaction (which represent returned principal). The remainder is the trading fee earned.

### Price Data

Historical USD prices at each block's timestamp are fetched from the [DeFiLlama API](https://defillama.com/docs/api) (free tier, no key required).

## Setup

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install web3 python-dotenv requests
```

### 2. Configure RPC

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
QUICKNODE_BASE_ENDPOINT=https://your-base-rpc-url.com
```

If omitted, the public `https://mainnet.base.org` endpoint is used (rate-limited).

### 3. Set your wallet and contracts

Edit `config.py`:

```python
# Your LP wallet address
ADDRESS = "0xYourWalletAddress"

# Aerodrome SlipStream Non Fungible Position Manager on Base
NFPM_ADDRESS = "0x827922686190790b37229fd06084350e74485b72"

# Gauge address(es) for your pool(s)
GAUGE_ADDRESSES = ["0xYourGaugeAddress"]

# Block range to analyze
FROM_BLOCK = 42487586    # start block
TO_BLOCK = None          # None = latest block
```

#### How to find your Gauge address

1. Go to [BaseScan](https://basescan.org) and search your wallet address
2. Look for transactions with `ClaimRewards` events
3. The contract that emits `ClaimRewards` is your Gauge address

## Usage

From the project root:

```bash
python -m Aerodrome.slipstream_pnl
```

### Debug mode

Set in `.env` to see detailed pipeline output (log counts, tokenIds, filtered events):

```env
TRACE_AERO_DEBUG=1
```

### Optional: DeFiLlama Pro

For higher rate limits, set your API key:

```env
DEFILLAMA_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

## Notes

- The script scans **all** NFPM events in the block range, then filters down to your wallet's tokenIds. Large block ranges with many events will require more RPC calls.
- Log fetching uses chunked requests (100 blocks per request) with automatic retry on HTTP 413 errors.
- Price and block-timestamp lookups are cached in memory to avoid redundant API/RPC calls within a single run.
- Gas costs are attributed to your wallet even when a bot pays the gas, since it is an operational cost of the LP strategy.
